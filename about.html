                <p>The Jump Ahead After School Program aims to reverse the childhood obesity trend in North Carolina while improving mental health and academic performance among elementary school students, all with the help of jump rope. This program will combine weekly jump rope clinics with nutrition education and healthy food options for after school programs around Chapel Hill and Durham. In addition, it will promote healthy lifestyles and educate elementary school students about the many components of health, including physical, mental, and social wellbeing. Through this program, students will be able to use jump rope as an outlet for building healthy relationships and self confidence, while learning a fun, new form of physical activity.</p>

                <p>The program includes a fun and healthy snack activity each week that incorporates locally sourced and easily accessible options. Students receive instructions and extra ingredients to take the activity home and do it again with family. We will be incorporating a nutrition lesson that corresponds to each weekâ€™s food activity to introduce basic health principles. The goal of this is to create a foundation for decision-making out of currently available and affordable options. The last component and arguably the most fun and unique is the jump rope workshops that will introduce the different jump rope areas ranging from single rope to double dutch. The goal here is to foster creativity, teamwork, and show that physical activity can be exciting and fun.</p>
